# csgo-slowmouse
Slowmouse is free csgo external hack, coded on c++ using visual studio, works only on Windows
This hack is undetectable at this moment, what does it use to be undetectable?
The cheat doesn't inject into the game, all what it does is reading and writing memory to specific addresses in memory(offsets)
If the cheat doesn't work is seems to be that offsets are changed, all what you have to do is just dump them and replace in the code

# SDK
SDK folder is not done entirely by me, but I have made a lot of modification and improvments
